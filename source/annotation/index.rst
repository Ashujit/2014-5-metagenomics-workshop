Metagenomic Annotation Workshop
=================================================
In this part of the metagenomics workshop we will:

- Translate nucleotides into amino acid seuquences using EMBOSS
- Annotate metagenomic reads with Pfam domains
- Discuss and perform normalization of metagenomic counts
- Perform a simple differential abundance analysis

The workshop has the following exercises:

1. TranslationExercise
2. HMMERExercise
3. NormalizationExercise
4. DifferentialExercise

At least a basic knowledge of how to work with the command line is required
otherwise it will be very difficult to follow some of the examples. Have
fun!
