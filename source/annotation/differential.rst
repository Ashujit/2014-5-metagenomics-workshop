Finally, we are about to do some real analysis of the data, and look
at the results! To do this, we will use the R statistical program.
You start the program by typing::
    
    R
    
You get out by typing::

    q()
    
You will need to quit it at once, because before we start using R,
we need to re-format the count table.
