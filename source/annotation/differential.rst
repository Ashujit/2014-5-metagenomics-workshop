Estimating differentially abundant protein families in the metagenomes
======================================================================
Finally, we are about to do some real analysis of the data, and look
at the results! To do this, we will use the R statistical program.
You start the program by typing::
    
    R
    
Loading the the count tables
============================

We will begin by loading the count tables from HMMER into R::

    b1 = read.table("baltic1.hmmsearch", sep = "", comment.char = "", skip = 3)

To get the number of entries of each kind, we will use the R command ``rle``.
We want to get the domain list, which is the third column. For ``rle`` to be
able to work with the data, we must also convert it into a proper vector.::

    raw_counts = rle(as.vector(b1[,3]))
    b1_counts = as.matrix(raw_counts$lengths)
    row.names(b1_counts) = raw_counts$values
    
Repeat this procedure for all four data sets.

Apply normalizations
====================

We will now try out the three different normalization methods to see their
effect on the data. First, we will try by normalizing to the number of reads
in each sequencing library. Find the note you have taken on the data set sizes.
Then apply a command like this on the data::

    b1_norm1 = b1_counts / 118025
    
You will now see counts in the range of 10^-5 and 10^6. To make these numbers
more interpretable, let's also multiply them by 1,000,000 to yield the counts
per million reads:

    b1_norm1 = b1_counts / 118025 * 1000000
    
Do the same thing for the other data sets.

We would then like to compare all the four data sets to each other. Since R's
merge function really suck for multiple data sets, I have provided this
function for merging four data sets. Copy and paste it into the R console::
    
    merge_four = function(a,b,c,d,names) {
    m1 = merge(a,b,by = "row.names", all = TRUE)
    row.names(m1) = m1[,1]
    m1 = m1[,2:3]
    m2 = merge(c, m1, by = "row.names", all = TRUE)
    row.names(m2) = m2[,1]
    m2 = m2[,2:4]
    m3 = merge(d, m2, by = "row.names", all = TRUE)
    row.names(m3) = m3[,1]
    m3 = m3[,2:5]
    m3[is.na(m3)] = 0
    colnames(m3) = c(names[4], names[3], names[1], names[2])
    return(m3)
    }
    
You can then try it by running this command on the raw counts::
    
    merge_four(b1_counts,b2_counts,swe_counts,ind_counts,c("Baltic 1","Baltic 2","India", "Sweden"))

You should then see a matrix containing all counts from the four data
sets, with each row corresponding to a Pfam family. Next, run the same
command on the normalized data and store the output into a variable.
